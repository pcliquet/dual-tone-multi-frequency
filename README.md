## Objective
The objective of the project is to create a software to detect what the user has typed.
To achive that, the code will assume that each signal will be generated by two sinusoids added, which will follow the table:

|        | 1209 Hz | 1336 Hz | 1477 Hz | 1633 Hz |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 697 Hz | 1       | 2       | 3       | A       |
| 770 Hz | 4       | 5       | 6       | B       |
| 852 Hz | 7       | 8       | 9       | C       |
| 941 Hz | X       | 0       | #       | D       |

This audio signal will be played by your computer's sound card and detected by another computer.

Ok, but how is this possible? To save you from a ton of math, it will use the [Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform "Wikipedia - Fourier Transform")
